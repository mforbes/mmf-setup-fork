Summary:

* https://alum.mit.edu/www/mforbes/hg/forbes-group/mmf-setup: Main development
  repository (Mercurial) running on our hosted [Heptapod] server.  This is where
  [Issues](https://alum.mit.edu/www/mforbes/hg/forbes-group/mmf-setup/issues), [Merge
  Requests](https://alum.mit.edu/www/mforbes/hg/forbes-group/mmf-setup/merge_requests)
  etc. should be reported.
* https://github.com/forbes-group/mmf-setup: Main public mirror (Git) for releases.
  Protected branches are automatically pushed here.  No development work should be done
  here: this is just for public access, and to use GitHub's CI tools.
* https://github.com/mforbes/mmf-setup-fork: My development fork (Git).  Everything
  is pushed here to use GitHub's CI tools during development.  Should not be used for
  anything else.
